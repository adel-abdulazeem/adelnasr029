### Hi there, I'm Adel ðŸ‘‹
-A full-stack web developer
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about on how to reflect your ideas into code to overcome your daily challenges and problems
- I dedicate myself to presenting my clients with completed projects that not only meet, but exceed, their initial vision. Knowing what to expect when we work together is critical - here is how I deliver success:
-Consultation - It all begins with a conversation where we'll pinpoint what this project is all about.
-Proposal - A detailed project proposal including a visual preview will be presented and a plan of action will be decided.
-Creation - Clients receive regular updates regarding their project status while I create and test it.
-Launch & Support - Peace of mind is delivered with the final project in the form of available ongoing support.
- âš¡ Fun fact: "do whatever it takes to not fool yourself to think something is true that is not or that something is not true that is."
